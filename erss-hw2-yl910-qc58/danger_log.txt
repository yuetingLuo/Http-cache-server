1. When the received response has errors or crashes, we need handle it graceful.
2. We only support GET, POST and CONNECT methods, in other situation, we need provide a bad response to client.
3. Instead of exiting the program immediately in the event of an error, the thread must be interrupted to prevent problems with other normally connected pages.
4. If the logs record requests or responses containing sensitive information (e.g., passwords, personal information) sent over HTTP (instead of HTTPS)
5. If the response from the server is unusual, like 404 not found, our proxy can handle this  and print it in logs.
6. When the number of cache block is larger than the capacity of our cache, we will check our chache and delete the oldest cache in it.
7. When we receive methods that we can not handle, 501 Not Implemented will be sent back to the client.
8. For cache, one cache doesn't has amx_age or it is 0, we will consider the cache needs revalidate.
9. The cached entry for a url may initially be of a type that must be revalidated (after expiration). However, in a future update, its cache type may change to not store, in which case we need to remove it from the cache.
